**Design Status**: Final / In Review / Needs Updates
**Designer**: @[designer-username]

## üì± Implementation Details

### Screens/Components to Build
- [ ] Component 1 - [Brief description]
- [ ] Component 2 - [Brief description]
- [ ] Screen 1 - [Brief description]

### Design Tokens to Use
```swift
// Colors
Theme.colors.primary // For main actions
Theme.colors.surface // For cards/containers

// Typography
Theme.fonts.title // For headers
Theme.fonts.body // For content

// Spacing

```

## üìç Context for Newcomers
[Explain what this screen/component does and where it fits in the app flow]

## üìÇ Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- `iOS/PersonalRepoCapture/Features/[Feature]/Views/[ComponentName].swift`
- `iOS/PersonalRepoCapture/Features/[Feature]/ViewModels/[ComponentName]ViewModel.swift`

### Files to Modify:
- `[Parent view that will contain this component]`

## ‚úÖ Design Compliance Checklist
- [ ] All colors use Theme system (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] All fonts use Theme system
- [ ] Spacing follows 8pt grid system
- [ ] Component is responsive to different screen sizes
- [ ] Animations match design specs (duration, easing)
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error states implemented
- [ ] Empty states implemented

## üåì Dark Mode Requirements
- [ ] Component looks good in light mode
- [ ] Component looks good in dark mode
- [ ] Colors have appropriate dark mode variants
- [ ] Sufficient contrast in both modes

## ‚ôø Accessibility Requirements

## üß™ Testing Instructions
1. Compare implementation with design pixel-by-pixel
2. Test all interactive states
3. Verify animations and transitions
4. Test on multiple device sizes
5. Test with Dynamic Type enabled
6. Test with VoiceOver enabled

## üéØ Definition of Done
