echo ""

# Get recent chat context
echo "=== WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON ==="
echo ""
echo "Think of this project like building with LEGO blocks, but instead of physical blocks,"
echo "we're using 'code' - which is just instructions that tell computers what to do."
echo ""

# Explain the current directory/project
if [ -f "README.md" ]; then
    echo "📁 PROJECT FOLDER:"
    echo "   We're in a folder called '$(basename $(pwd))' - think of it like a big box"

## AI Assistant ELI5 Explanation Prompt

```
Please explain our current conversation and any work performed in extremely simple terms for someone who has never programmed before.

**Context to Explain:**
- What is this project about?
- What have we been working on together?
- What did I do to help?
- What are the results?

**Explanation Requirements:**

**1. Use Simple Analogies:**
- Compare code to familiar things (recipes, LEGO instructions, etc.)
- Explain technical terms with everyday examples
- Use metaphors a 5-year-old would understand

**2. Avoid Technical Jargon:**
- Replace "repository" with "project folder"
- Replace "commit" with "save our work"
- Replace "merge" with "combine changes"
- Replace "deploy" with "put online for everyone to use"

**3. Explain the Big Picture:**
- Why are we doing this work?
- How does it help users?
- What problem are we solving?

**4. Break Down Complex Actions:**
If I performed multiple steps, explain each one simply:
- "First, I looked at..."
- "Then, I changed..."
- "After that, I tested..."
- "Finally, I saved..."

**5. Use Encouraging Language:**
- Focus on progress and achievements
- Explain why each step was important
- Make it sound approachable, not scary

**Example Structure:**
```
🏠 **What This Project Is:**
Think of this like building a digital house. We're creating something on the computer that people can use.

🔧 **What We Did Today:**
1. [Simple explanation of action 1]
2. [Simple explanation of action 2]
3. [Simple explanation of action 3]

🎉 **What This Means:**
Now users can [benefit they'll get] because we [what we accomplished].

🚀 **What's Next:**
The next step would be to [simple next action] so that [simple benefit].
```

Remember: No technical terms without explanation, use lots of analogies, and focus on the human benefit of our work.
```

## Simple Explanations Reference

echo "=== BEGINNER-FRIENDLY EXPLANATIONS ==="
echo ""
echo "🤔 COMMON PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS EXPLAINED SIMPLY:"
echo ""
echo "📄 FILE = Like a document on your computer, but with special instructions"
echo "📁 FOLDER/DIRECTORY = Like a filing cabinet drawer that organizes related files"
echo "💾 SAVE/COMMIT = Like hitting 'Save' on a Word document, but for code"
echo "🌿 BRANCH = Like making a copy to try changes without messing up the original"
echo "🔄 MERGE = Combining your changes with the main version"
echo "🐛 BUG = When something doesn't work the way it should (like a typo)"
echo "🧪 TEST = Checking if everything works correctly (like proofreading)"
echo "📦 PACKAGE/LIBRARY = Pre-built code tools (like using a cake mix instead of from scratch)"
echo "🌐 DEPLOY = Putting your project online so others can use it"
echo "📋 ISSUE = A to-do item or problem report"

## Project Status in Simple Terms

```bash
echo "=== PROJECT STATUS FOR BEGINNERS ==="

# Check git status in simple terms
if git status &>/dev/null; then
    CHANGES=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l)
    if [ "$CHANGES" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ ALL WORK SAVED: Everything is safely stored, like a completed puzzle"
    else
        echo "📝 WORK IN PROGRESS: We have $CHANGES files with unsaved changes"
        echo "   (Like having some puzzle pieces on the table, not yet in the box)"
    fi
else
    echo "📁 SIMPLE PROJECT: This is just a regular folder with files"
fi

# Explain project structure simply
echo ""
echo "📂 WHAT'S IN OUR PROJECT BOX:"
if [ -f "README.md" ]; then

fi
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "   📦 package.json - The ingredients list (what tools our project needs)"
fi
if [ -d "src" ]; then
    echo "   📁 src/ - The main building blocks (where most of our code lives)"
fi

    echo "   🕐 .git/ - The time machine (keeps track of all our changes)"
fi

echo ""
echo "🎯 PROJECT PURPOSE:"
if [ -f "README.md" ]; then
    echo "   This project helps people by: [AI will explain the main purpose]"
else
    echo "   [AI will explain what this project does based on the files]"

echo "1. 🎓 LEARNING PATH:"
echo "   - Don't worry about understanding everything right now"
echo "   - Think of programming like learning a new language"
echo "   - Start with small changes and see what happens"
echo "   - Ask questions! Every programmer was a beginner once"
echo ""
echo "2. 🛠️ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "   - Watch what I do and ask 'why' when you're curious"
echo "   - Try making small changes to see what happens"
echo "   - Don't be afraid to 'break' things - that's how you learn!"
echo "   - Remember: every expert was once a complete beginner"
echo ""
echo "3. 🎉 CELEBRATE PROGRESS:"
echo "   - You're already learning by asking questions"
echo "   - Every small step counts"
echo "   - Programming is like solving puzzles - it's supposed to be fun!"
echo ""
echo "💡 REMEMBER: Programming is just giving very detailed instructions to a computer."
echo "   It's like writing a recipe, but the computer follows it exactly as written!"
