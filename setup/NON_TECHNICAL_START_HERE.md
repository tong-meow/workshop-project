# 🚀 AI Starter Kit - Setup Guide for Everyone

Welcome! This guide will help you set up everything you need to start building with AI, even if you've never coded before.

## What This Does

The AI Starter Kit helps you:
- Write better instructions to AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Fix common problems when AI writes code
- Build real projects step by step
- Work like a professional developer

## 📦 What Gets Installed

Our setup scripts install these tools automatically:

1. **Git** - Tracks changes to your code (like "Track Changes" in Word)
2. **Node.js** - Runs JavaScript code on your computer
3. **Cursor** - A smart code editor that works with AI
4. **Claude Code** - Command-line tool for Claude AI
5. **GitHub CLI** - Manages your code projects online

Don't worry if you don't know what these are - the scripts handle everything!

   - The script will open download pages automatically

## 🎯 After Setup

Once setup is complete:

1. **Open Cursor**
   - The script installed this for you
   - It's like Microsoft Word but for code

2. **Read the Guide**
   - Open `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Start with "Part 1: Common AI Problems"
   - Try the examples with your own projects

3. **Try a Template**
   - Look in the `templates/` folder
   - Copy any template you need
   - Fill it in for your project

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Terminal says 'permission denied'"
Run this command first:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### "I don't have a GitHub account"
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
- Click "Sign up" (it's free)
- Use the same email you gave during setup

### "What's Git asking for?"
Git needs your name and email to track who makes changes. Use:
- Your real name (or nickname)
- An email you check regularly

### "Can I delete the installer after?"
Keep the `ai-starter-kit` folder - it has guides and templates you'll use.

## 🆘 Need Help?

If something goes wrong:

1. **Close and reopen Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Try running the script again**
3. **Check you're in the right folder** (should see files when you type `ls` or `dir`)

Remember: Everyone starts somewhere. You're learning tools that professional developers use every day!

## 🎉 You're Ready!

After setup, you'll have the same tools professional developers use. The difference? Our guides show you exactly how to use them with AI to build real things.
