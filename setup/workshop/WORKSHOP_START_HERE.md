# ðŸš€ AI Workshop - Simple Guide

*Build working software with AI in 90 minutes - no coding experience needed!*

## Pre-Workshop Setup (30 minutes before)

### For Non-Technical Participants:
1. **Run the setup script**:
   - Mac: Double-click `workshop-setup.sh`
   - Windows: Run `workshop-setup.bat`
2. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter your project name (like "chess-puzzle")
   - Say "y" when asked to open browser
3. **Edit your PRD** (if you have one):
   - Find: `docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md`
   - Replace with your content

**That's it!** The script created your GitHub repo, set up automation, and created issue #1.

## Workshop Starts Here!

### You Should Already Have:
- âœ… A GitHub repository (check your browser)
- âœ… All automation configured
- âœ… Issue #1: "Parse PRD into Development Tasks"
- âœ… Cursor installed and ready

### Open Cursor:
1. Open the Cursor app
2. Open your project folder (the one with your project name)
3. You're ready to start!

## Step 1: Work on the PRD Parsing Issue (20 min)

### Now work on issue #1 with this prompt:

```
I want to work on issue #1 "Parse PRD into Development Tasks".

Please:
1. Read the PRD from docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md
2. Read the PRD parsing prompt from templates/PRD_PARSING_PROMPT.md
3. Use that prompt to parse the PRD into 4-6 subtask issues
4. Create each subtask issue on GitHub using the newcomer-standard-issue template
5. Link them all as subtasks of issue #1

Repository: [YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]

Show me the commands for each subtask issue.
```

**What happens**: The AI will create all your development tasks as proper GitHub issues!

---

## Step 2: Start Real Development! (30 min)

### Pick one of the newly created subtask issues and use this prompt:

```
I want to start working on issue #[PICK A SUBTASK NUMBER].

Please:
1. Create a feature branch for this issue
2. Implement the requirements from the issue
3. Follow the acceptance criteria exactly
4. Commit the changes with a good message
5. Push the branch and create a pull request

Repository: [YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]

Guide me step by step.
```

**Follow along**: Cursor will guide you through building the actual feature!

---

## Step 3: See the Magic! (10 min)

### Check your automation:

```
Please show me:
1. How to view my GitHub Actions running
2. How to see my project board
3. How to check if my PR passed all checks

Repository: [YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]

Open these in my browser.
```

### Watch as:
- âœ… Your PR gets validated automatically
- âœ… Labels are applied
- âœ… Project board updates
- âœ… Checks run on your code

---

## Bonus: Keep Building! (30 min)

### For your next issue:

```
I finished issue #1! Now I want to:
1. Merge my PR if all checks passed
2. Start on issue #2
3. Follow the same workflow

Guide me through this.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Checklist

By the end, you'll have:
- âœ… A GitHub repository with your project
- âœ… Automated workflows running
- âœ… 1 parent issue for PRD parsing
- âœ… 4-6 subtask issues from your PRD
- âœ… Your first feature PR created
- âœ… A working development process

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Let AI do the work:
- **Don't memorize commands** - Ask AI each time
- **Be specific** - Include your repo name and username
- **Check the browser** - GitHub shows visual confirmation
- **Trust the process** - Automation handles the complex parts

### Common AI prompts:

**"Something went wrong"**
```
I got this error: [PASTE ERROR]
How do I fix it?
```

**"I want to see my progress"**
```
Show me how to view all my:
- Open issues
- Pull requests  
- Project board
In the browser.
```
